## 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction (Proposal Stage)

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from IBM (via Kaggle). Customer churn -- when a user leaves for a competitor -- is a critical business issue, and predicting it accurately can help telecom providers retain valuable customers.

### 🔍 Project Goals
- Build and evaluate classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- Handle class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Identify key features driving churn
- Compare results with prior research (Wu & Liu, 2021)

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **pandas**, **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

> **Status**: This project is currently in the proposal and planning phase.
